1. StackLayout and ScrollView
 StackLayout has Children property, so generally there are a few/couple of views(Label, Button, TextBox etc) in the stacklayout, but scrollview only has Content property, this is defined for the senario similar: eBook reading, display articles, allow user scrolling down or up.
 To be remember: we can set IsClippedToBounds perperty to True, in this case, the contents in the scrollview can't overflow out the scrollview's bounds.
